# Homework 1: simple linked list

The following should work when you are done with your assignment:

```
$ make
$ ./test
$ make clean
```

Your `main.c` must include a comprehensive test suite.
We will test with our own `main.c` by doing:

```
$ mv main.c main.c.saved
$ cp ../ourmain.c main.c
$ make
$ ./test
...our unit tests run here
$ mv main.c.saved main.c
```
